# 🌐 Task 05 - Network Packet Analyzer  
## Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship  

---

## 📌 Task Objective  
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets.  
Display relevant information such as source IP, destination IP, protocols, and payload data.  
Ensure ethical use for educational purposes.

---

## 💻 Project Description  
This project is developed as part of Task 05 during my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

The tool captures live network packets using Python and the Scapy library.  
It analyzes each packet and displays:

- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Payload data (if available)

The sniffer captures a fixed number of packets and then stops automatically.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Scapy library  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Captures live network packets  
- Displays source and destination IP  
- Identifies protocol type  
- Shows payload data  
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation
